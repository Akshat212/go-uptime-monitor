# Go Uptime Monitor

A lightweight uptime monitoring application built using **Go**, **Docker**, **AWS ECS Fargate**, and **Terraform**. This application monitors the uptime of various services and exposes endpoints for health, status, and monitoring control.

> üîó **Hosted URL**: [`monitor.modulynx.in`](http://monitor.modulynx.in)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The service may not always be running due to infrastructure cost optimizations. Please refer to the deployment instructions to set it up on your own AWS environment.

## üß† Features

- Written in **Go** for performance and concurrency
- API endpoints:
  - `GET /health` ‚Äì Health check for the server
  - `GET /monitored` ‚Äì View all currently monitored URLs
  - `POST /monitor` ‚Äì Add a new URL to monitor uptime
- Built as a **Docker container** and deployed via **ECS Fargate**
- Infrastructure managed via **Terraform**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Frontend**: Exposed via **Application Load Balancer** (ALB)
- **Backend**: Go HTTP server hosted in ECS Fargate containers
- **Logging**: Integrated with **AWS CloudWatch Logs**
- **Networking**: VPC with public subnets and security groups
- **Domain**: `monitor.modulynx.in` pointing to the ALB via **GoDaddy DNS + ACM certificate**
